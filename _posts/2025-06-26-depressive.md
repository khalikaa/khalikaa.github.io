This dashboard is a final project for a Data Mining course, developed to identify the most influential factors that contribute to the risk of depressive disorder. Using data from the BRFSS survey, the project groups features into four categoriesâ€”demographics, medical conditions, lifestyle, and social determinantsâ€”and applies a HistGradientBoosting machine learning model to analyze which factors have the strongest impact on depression risk.
